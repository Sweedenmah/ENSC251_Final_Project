Note: unless otherwise specified, N is the length of the list being
operated upon.

  FUNCTION NAME                 BIG-O    EXPLANATION
  ----------------------------- -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  pop()                         O(1)     There’s no looping behaviour
  insert()                      O(N)     Since the list must stay sorted, it must be traversed (by means of a loop) in order to discover the correct place to insert the given value. In the worst case, the entire list will have to be traversed.
  Searching by name             O(N^2)   Must traverse the list once in order to find all matching items, thus O(N). In order to be case-insensitive it has to capitalize each string in the list, which is O(M) where M is the length of the string, so the worst-case scenario is O(N^2).
  Searching by attribute        O(N)     Same as above, without the requirement to capitalize, making it O(N)
  searchAndDestroy()            O(N^2)   Must iterate through the entire list in order to find all items to be destroyed, thus O(N). Similarly to the previous function category, the capitalization loops push this to O(N^2).
  aLittleOffTheTopAndBottom()   O(N)     Deleting the head and tail simultaneously is O(1), but resetting the tail pointer to the new end of the list requires traversing the list, making this function O(N).
  showAllOverThreshold()        O(N)     Must iterate through the whole list in order to print all students that validate the criteria.
  insertNew()                   O(N)     There aren’t any loops when inserting a new custom student, but it calls insert(), which is O(N) and thus overrides the otherwise O(1) function.
  merge()                       O(N^2)   Must traverse the new list once for each item in the domestic and international lists. This means that it has a nested loop, automatically making this function O(N^2)
